This project is based on a self-built model DIGNP, which is a dynamic model based on System Dynamics that prioritizes the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by creating a network of indicators and goals. It utilizes correlation analysis and the Entropy Weight Method to establish priorities and forecasts the future evolution of the SDGs using ARIMA. The model can dynamically adjust its topology and rankings based on changes in indicators or goals, making it adaptable to various scenarios and international crises.

This project focuses on campus data analysis using Federated Learning, a privacy-preserving machine learning technique. It aims to analyze multidimensional campus data and create accurate student profiles, enhancing campus management, and providing personalized guidance to students with data anomalies to promote their physical and mental well-being. By employing established machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, the project utilizes Horizontal Federated Learning based on FedProx to correlate cafeteria consumption with BMI, ensuring privacy protection with measures like differential privacy. Additionally, Federated Transfer Learning is employed to predict graduate students' academic performance by utilizing undergraduate student data, which contains more features.

This research proposes a clustering-based method for estimating the number of multipath components in time-variant multipath channels, specifically for cellular-based positioning receivers. The method leverages the kernel-power-density clustering algorithm to improve accuracy and reliability. Traditional multipath number estimation methods, such as information theoretic criteria (ITC)-based approaches, often suffer from overestimation and rely on empirically tuned thresholds. In contrast, the proposed method leverages clustering algorithms, specifically the kernel-power-density (KPD)-based clustering algorithm, to effectively estimate the number of multipath components in the channel. By employing clustering algorithms to analyze multipath signals, it effectively filters out random noise points that may be wrongly estimated by the ITC approach. This improvement leads to more precise and reliable estimation of the number of multipath components, particularly in dynamic channel environments and scenarios with dense multipath reflections.
